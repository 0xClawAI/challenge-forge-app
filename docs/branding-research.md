## 1. App Name Ideas (18 Options)

### ⚠️ Important: "Forge" is Already Taken
There's an existing App Store app called **"Forge: 75 Days Hard Challenge"** (id6746106520). Using "Challenge Forge" risks confusion and potential trademark issues. Strongly recommend a different name.

### Top Tier (Recommended)
| # | Name | Why It Works |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Crucible** | Means "a test of strength" — premium, unique, no App Store conflicts |
| 2 | **IronRule** | Evokes discipline + custom rules. No conflicts found. |
| 3 | **Anvil** | Where things are forged/shaped. Short, memorable, premium. |
| 4 | **DayProof** | "Prove yourself daily." Keyword-friendly (day + proof). |
| 5 | **Grindstone** | Gritty, action-oriented, unique in the App Store. |

### Strong Contenders
| # | Name | Why It Works |
|---|------|-------------|
| 6 | **Resolute** | Premium feel, means "determined." Clean namespace. |
| 7 | **Tenacity** | Strong branding, conveys the product's ethos. |
| 8 | **The Standard** | "Set your standard." Premium, aspirational. |
| 9 | **Unbroken** | Streak-focused mindset. Powerful brand identity. |
| 10 | **Hardwire** | "Hardwire your habits." Tech-modern feel. |

### Keyword-Rich Options (Better for ASO)
| # | Name | Subtitle Opportunity |
|---|------|---------------------|
| 11 | **MyChallenge** | "Custom 75 Hard Alternative & Daily Tracker" |
| 12 | **ChallengeKit** | "Build Your Own 75 Hard" |
| 13 | **DailyProve** | "Custom Challenge & Habit Tracker" |
| 14 | **ChallengeCraft** | "Design Your Own 75 Hard Challenge" |
| 15 | **RuleBreaker** | "Custom Challenge Tracker — Your Rules" |

### Wildcard / Bold
| # | Name | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 16 | **75 You** | Leverages "75" keyword. "Your challenge, your rules." |
| 17 | **Day One Protocol** | Premium, military/discipline vibe. |
| 18 | **FORJ** | Stylized "forge" without the trademark conflict. |

## 3. Competitor Analysis

### Top 5 Challenge/Habit Apps on iOS

| # | App | Rating | Pricing | Key Differentiator |
|---|-----|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **75 Hard** (Official) | 4.6 ⭐ (6.4K) | Free + **subscription** (requires sub for full access) | Official brand. Rigid rules, no customization. |
| 2 | **Better (75 Days Challenge)** | 4.8 ⭐ (568) | Free + **$29.99/year** or weekly/lifetime options | Custom challenges, photo progress, widgets. **Most direct competitor.** |
| 3 | **Forge: 75 Days Hard Challenge** | New | Free + in-app purchases | Community feed, multiple challenge templates (75 Hard/Soft/Medium). |
| 4 | **Streaks** | 4.9 ⭐ (55K+) | **$4.99 one-time** | Apple Design Award winner. Simple habit tracker (not challenge-specific). |
| 5 | **Habitica** | 4.5 ⭐ | Free + **$47.99/year** or $4.99/mo | Gamified RPG habit tracker. Not challenge-focused. |

### Pricing Landscape Summary

| Model | Examples | Typical Price |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| One-time purchase | Streaks | $4.99 |
| Annual subscription | Better, Habitica, Productive | $24–$48/year |
| Monthly subscription | Way of Life, Productive | $2–$5/month |
| Freemium + sub | 75 Hard Official, Forge | Free base + sub |
| Lifetime unlock | Habit Tracker app | $30–$50 |

### 💰 Pricing Analysis for $14.99 Lifetime

**Verdict: Well-positioned.**
- More than Streaks ($4.99) but Streaks is a general habit tracker with no challenge structure
- Less than one year of Better ($29.99/yr) — strong value proposition
- Lifetime eliminates subscription fatigue (a selling point many users love — multiple App Store reviews praise lifetime pricing)
- **Recommended positioning:** "One price. No subscriptions. Your challenge, forever."

### Competitive Gaps (Our Opportunity)
1. **Official 75 Hard** is rigid — no customization. Users want flexibility.
2. **Better** is closest competitor but charges $30/yr subscription — we undercut with lifetime.
3. **No app owns "build your own challenge"** as a primary brand position.
4. **Community features** (Forge has them) are emerging — consider for v2.
5. **Most challenge apps target 75 Hard specifically** — positioning as "any challenge, any duration" is open territory.
